Kastel Is a Chatting App like <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> & <a href="https://guilded.gg">Guilded</a>, Though its Open Sourced. With Encrypted Chat and No selling of User Data.

## Roadmap
- [x] Route Handler/Loader (Loads Routes, Set Routes ETC.)
- [x] Start MongoDB Stuff (Creating Schemas, Using it for Creating accounts ETC)
- [x] A Better ID System
- [x] Correct Error codes
- [ ] Encrypting User Data and messages, Username, ID ETC & Hashing Passwords, Emails and IPS
- [ ] API Endpoints for Creating Accounts, Updating Accounts, Deleting Accounts ETC
- [ ] Routing to Different servers
    - If you are in Canada, Route to a US server if there are no canada servers ETC
- [ ] Docker File to easily run the backend
- [ ] Advanced Caching system using redis
    - Caching system to make API requests faster
- [ ] User creation from CLI
    - Useful for creating the first account
- [ ] Rewrite to TS
    - This project would be much better in TS, I currently do not have the time to set TS up but if you would like to I would love it.
